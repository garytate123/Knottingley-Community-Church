                    <p>The Vision of Knottingley Community Church.</p>
                    <p>There are four words that we are committed to as a church...</p>
                    <strong>1. Cornerstone</strong>
                    <p>
                        This is taken from Ephesians 2:20. We believe that Jesus Christ is the cornerstone of us as a
                        church and we strive to keep Jesus Christ at the centre of all we do.
                    </p>
                    <strong>
                        2. Salvation
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                        This is taken from both Matthew 28:16-20 and 1 Corinthians 9:19-23. Salvation is part of the
                        mission of the church and we will do all we can to strive as a church to see salvation in all
                        that we do.
                    </p>
                    <strong>
                        3. Discipleship
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                        This is taken again from Matthew 28:16-20. This is the great commission and Jesus Christ calls
                        all of us to go and make disciples. We strive to ensure intentional discipleship is a part of
                        all we do.
                    </p>
                    <strong>
                        4. Community
                    </strong>
                    <p>
                        This is taked from Acts 2:42-47. It is clear that the early church thrived partly due to the
                        sense of community the early church had. We strive to be a community for the community. A place
                        where all are welcome and welcomed warmly. A place where we strive to work together, for one
                        another, not just for the good of each other but for the good of our communities too. At
                        Knottingley Elim we hold this very highly.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <strong>
                        LIVING THE MISSION THROUGH COMMUNITY
                    </strong>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        This is the vision statement of the church and something that we hold onto when moving forwards.
                        We are big believers in the power of community. We believe that as a church we have a
                        responsibility to each other to form a community that cares and supports each other. However,
                        when we look at the wider community we see people everywhere needing a connection, wanting to
                        belong to something and to be cared for. We want the local community to feel like they have a
                        place to go where they can be welcomed by a warm loving church community. This is at the core
                        and heart of who we are as a church and what we strive for. For people to be part of, see and
                        experience the love of Christ, through this community of believers.

                        Belief</h5>
                        <strong>The Bible:</strong>
                        <p>We believe the Bible,as originally given, to be without error, the fully inspired and infallible Word of God and the supreme and final authority in all matters of faith and conduct. </p>

                        <strong>The Trinity:</strong>
                        <p>We believe that the Godhead exists co-equally and co-eternally in three persons - Father, Son and Holy Spirit - and that these three are one God, sovereign in creation, providence and redemption.</p>

                        <strong>The Saviour:</strong>
                        <p>We believe in the true and proper deity of our Lord Jesus Christ, in His virgin birth, in His real and complete humanity, in His sinless life, in His authoritative teaching, in His substitutionary and atoning sacrifice through His blood shed, in His bodily resurrection, in His ascension to the right hand of the Father, in His heavenly intercession and His second advent to receive His Church. </p>

                        <strong>The Holy Spirit:</strong>
                        <p>We believe in the deity of the Holy Spirit who proceeds from the Father and the Son and the necessity of His work in conviction of sin, repentance, regeneration and sanctification, and that the believer is also promised an enduement of power as the gift of Christ through the baptism in the Holy Spirit with signs following. Through this enduement the believer is empowered for fuller participation in the ministry of the Church, its worship, evangelism and service. </p>

                        <strong>Mankind:</strong>
                        <p>We believe in the universal sinfulness of all men since the Fall, rendering man subject to God’s wrath and condemnation.</p>

                        <strong>Salvation:</strong>
                        <p>We believe in the necessity for salvation of repentance towards God and faith in the Lord Jesus Christ by which the sinner is pardoned and accepted as righteous in God’s sight. This justification is imputed by the grace of God because of the atoning work of Christ, is received by faith alone and is evidenced by the Fruit of the Spirit and a holy life.</p>

                        <strong>The Church:</strong>
                        <p>We believe in the spiritual unity and the priesthood of all believers in Christ and that these comprise the universal Church, the Body of Christ.</p>

                        <strong>The Ministry:</strong>
                        <p>We believe in the ministries that Christ has set in His Church, namely, apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors and teachers and in the present operation of the manifold Gifts of the Holy Spirit according to the New Testament.</p>

                        <strong>The Ordinances:</strong>
                        <p>We believe in the baptism of believers in water in obedience to the command of Christ and the commemoration of Christ’s death by the observance of the Lord’s Supper until His return.</p>

                        <strong>The Commission:</strong>
                        <p>We believe that the Gospel embraces the needs of the whole man and that the Church is therefore commissioned to preach the Gospel to the world and to fulfil a ministry of healing and deliverance to the spiritual and physical needs of mankind.</p>

                        <strong>The Coming King:</strong>
                        <p>We believe in the personal, physical and visible return of the Lord Jesus Christ to reign in power and glory.</p>

                        <strong>The Future State:</strong>
                        <p>We believe in the resurrection of the dead and in the final judgement of the world, the eternal conscious bliss of the righteous and the eternal conscious punishment of the wicked.</p>
